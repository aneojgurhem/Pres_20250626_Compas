   \frametitle{The Decline of the Scientific Polymath}

   \begin{itemize}
     \item \textbf{17th–18th centuries:} Scientists like Newton and Leibniz contributed across disciplines — science was relatively unified.
     \item \textbf{19th century:} Rapid growth of disciplines (e.g., chemistry, biology, physics); first signs of specialization.
     \item \textbf{20th century:} Explosion of subfields and technical complexity; solo mastery becomes impossible.
     \item \textbf{Today:} Even within a single field (e.g., AI, genetics), experts specialize narrowly — cross-field comprehension is rare.
   \end{itemize}

   \begin{block}{Result}
     \begin{itemize}
       \item No one scientist can read or understand all scientific publications.
       \item Applicable to HPC : It is increasingly difficult to master all its fields.
     \end{itemize}

   \begin{itemize}
     \item \textbf{Hardware/Software}
           \begin{itemize}
             \item \textbf{Programming Languages:} C, C++, Python, Fortran, etc.
             \item \textbf{Compilers:} GCC, Intel, LLVM, etc.
           \end{itemize}
     \item \textbf{Software/Scientific Problem}
           \begin{itemize}

   \begin{alertblock}{Are they good enough?}
     \begin{itemize}
       \item Yes ! For the trade-off they were designed for.
       \item Still, they need deep expertise to be used effectively.
     \end{itemize}
   \end{alertblock}
 \end{frame}

 \begin{frame}{Why Look Beyond Current Interfaces?}
   \begin{itemize}
     \item Complexity of heterogeneous systems is growing rapidly.
     \item Experts are required to bridge hardware/software/application gaps.
     \item Scientific applications need:
           \begin{itemize}
             \item Scalability without re-architecting code.
             \item Transparent access to diverse computing resources.
             \item Efficient resource utilization and orchestration.
           \end{itemize}
     \item Current solutions lack:
           \begin{itemize}
             \item Flexibility across architectures.
             \item Seamless integration and automation.
             \item User-friendly interfaces for scientists and engineers.
